# Javascript and Classes

# Js is a prototypes based language
-> Classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype based inheritance mechannisam .
-> in other words it provides a more  familiar syntax for the developers coming from class based languages sucha as java or c++

## OOP => (programming paradigm) => style/structure of writing code

## Object 
- collection of properties (variables) and method(functions)
- toLowercase, touppercase , promises=> objects

## why use OOP?
code messup  -> speghati code ( any source code that's hard to understand because it has no defined structure.)

## parts of OOP
object literal -> {}

- constructor function
- prototype
- classes
- instances (new,this)

## 4 pillars 
Abtraction -> hide details (like fetch)
Encapsulation -> (wrap up -> hide)
Inheritance
Polymorphism -> many faces (one method do many things)

## Abstraction:
- Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

## Example: Consider a Car class. A car has various functions like startEngine(), stopEngine(), and accelerate(). When you drive a car, you don't need to know how the engine starts internally. You just use the startEngine() method. This is abstractionâ€”you're interacting with the car through its essential features without needing to know the underlying details.

## ENCAPSULATION
- wrapping up data member and function
