    <!-- UNSENT
The XMLHttpRequest client has been created, but the open() method hasn't been called yet.

OPENED
open() method has been invoked. During this state, the request headers can be set using the setRequestHeader() method and the send() method can be called which will initiate the fetch.

HEADERS_RECEIVED
send() has been called, all redirects (if any) have been followed and the response headers have been received.

LOADING
Response's body is being received. If responseType is "text" or empty string, responseText will have the partial text response as it loads.

DONE
The fetch operation is complete. This could mean that either the data transfer has been completed successfully or failed. -->
