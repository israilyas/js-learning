Javascript
  => synchronous -> (code execute one by one)
  => Single threaded (everything execute on one thread)
  => default Js behavior

  (javascript engine + runtime Environment (nodejs/browser))

=> +++++ Execution Context +++++
   => execute one line of code at a time
   => console log -> 1
   => console log -> 2

each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

   => callstack  => memory heap

+++++  Blocking code   VS Non Blocking code ++++++

==> Blocking code
   ->Block the flow of programme
   ->Read file sync
   
    
==>Non Blocking code
   ->Does not Block the flow of programme
   ->Read file async
